## User Story

As an employee with access to sensitive data
I want to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
so that I can create a strong password that provides greater security.

## Application

I was required to create an application that an employee can use to generate a random password based the following criteria:

1.) The length of the password must contain at least 8 characters but less than 128.

2.) The user must select one or more of the following types of characters: Lower case characters, Upper case characters, Numeric characters, or Special characters.

This application runs in the browser, and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code. It has a clean and polished user interface that is responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.

## Here is a link to the deployed application as well as a screenshot showing how said application works.
